# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement? 
- I feel very comfortable with the integer based for statements. Once arrays and if statement get involved it became more confusing. After going into study hall and doing the final three challenges with others, I'm feeling more comfortable.  

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- It was hard, and there were many ups and downs. I took breaks but it was still very difficult. I had both types of struggle. I took breaks and reached out for help  when struggle became unproductive.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I need to go over `for` statements, both by myself and with others. I will try to take time to do taht in the morning and tomorrow if I have time. 

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- It will depend on the problem, but just continuing to understand `for` statements.
